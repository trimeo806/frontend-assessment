# Plan — Unified Planning Command

## Delegation — REQUIRED

This skill MUST run via the `planner` agent, not inline.

**When `/plan` or planning intent is detected:**
1. Use the **Agent tool** to spawn `planner`
2. Pass the full user request + active context (branch, plan dir, CWD)
3. Do NOT execute planning steps inline in the main conversation

---

Create implementation plans with automatic complexity detection.

## Step 0 — Flag Override

If `$ARGUMENTS` starts with `--fast`: skip auto-detection, load `references/fast-mode.md` and execute. Remaining args are the task description.
If `$ARGUMENTS` starts with `--deep`: skip auto-detection, load `references/deep-mode.md` and execute.
If `$ARGUMENTS` starts with `--parallel`: skip auto-detection, load `references/parallel-mode.md` and execute.
If `$ARGUMENTS` starts with `--validate`: skip auto-detection, load `references/validate-mode.md` and execute.
Otherwise: continue to Complexity Auto-Detection.

## Aspect Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `references/fast-mode.md` | Quick plan from codebase analysis only, no research |
| `references/deep-mode.md` | Deep plan with sequential research and comprehensive analysis |
| `references/parallel-mode.md` | Dependency-aware plan with file ownership matrix for parallel execution |
| `references/validate-mode.md` | Validate plan with critical questions interview |
| `references/state-machine-guide.md` | State machine notation, patterns, and validation checklist |
| `references/planning-flow.dot` | Planning flow diagram |

## Plan Output Contract

Every plan is a **directory** with a `plan.md` overview and one phase file per phase:

```
plans/{YYMMDD-HHMM-slug}/
  plan.md                    — overview, phases table with file links, success criteria
  phase-{N}-{slug}.md        — tasks, files to change, validation per phase
```

**plan.md frontmatter** (required fields):
```yaml
---
title: "Short description"
status: draft | active | completed | archived
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
effort: Xh
phases: N
platforms: [all | ios | android | web | backend]
breaking: true | false
---
```

**phase file frontmatter** (required fields):
```yaml
---
phase: N
title: "Phase title"
effort: Xh
depends: []   # phase numbers this phase depends on
---
```

**Phases table in plan.md must link to phase files:**
```markdown
| # | Phase | Effort | Status | File |
|---|-------|--------|--------|------|
| 1 | Name | 2h | pending | [phase-1](./phase-1-slug.md) |
```

## Plan Lifecycle

```
draft → active → completed → archived
```

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Activate | `node .claude/scripts/set-active-plan.cjs plans/{slug}` |
| Complete | `node .claude/scripts/complete-plan.cjs plans/{slug}` |
| Archive | `node .claude/scripts/archive-plan.cjs plans/{slug}` |
| Board | `plans/README.md` — updated by scripts automatically |

**MANDATORY final step** — after writing all plan files, run:
```bash
node .claude/scripts/set-active-plan.cjs plans/{slug}
```
This stamps `status: active` in `plan.md` and registers the plan in session state so `/cook` picks it up automatically. Do NOT skip this step.

## Complexity Auto-Detection

1. **Simple** (1 module, clear scope, < 5 files) → load `references/fast-mode.md`
2. **Moderate** (multiple files, some research needed) → load `references/deep-mode.md`
3. **Complex** (multi-module, cross-platform, needs dependency mapping) → load `references/parallel-mode.md`

## Platform Detection

Detect platform per `skill-discovery` protocol. Pass detected platform as context to the selected variant.

## Heuristics

- Single sentence request → `:fast`
- Request mentions "research" or "investigate" → `:deep`
- Request mentions multiple platforms or modules → `:parallel`
- Request mentions "dependencies" or "phases" → `:parallel`
- If unsure → default to `:fast`, escalate if needed

## Planning Expertise

| Area | Key Activities |
|------|---------------|
| Requirements | Clarify ambiguity, extract functional + non-functional, identify edge cases |
| Task Breakdown | Decompose, order by dependency, estimate complexity |
| Dependencies | External packages, internal code, blockers, parallel opportunities |
| Risk Assessment | Technical/timeline/resource risks, mitigation strategies |
| Resource Estimation | Time per task, complexity levels, testing overhead |
| Timeline | Critical path, milestones, buffer allocation |

## Planning Framework

1. **Understand** — Clarify requirements
2. **Decompose** — Break into smaller tasks
3. **Sequence** — Order by dependency
4. **Estimate** — Time/complexity per task
5. **Identify** — Potential blockers
6. **Document** — Create structured plan

## State Machine Modeling

When feature involves stateful behavior (UI flows, protocols, async state, workflows), generate ASCII state diagram BEFORE coding:

1. List all states (including error, timeout, edge states)
2. Map every transition (trigger + guard conditions)
3. Identify terminal states and dead ends
4. Mark states where data is mutated

```
[INITIAL] ──(event)──▸ [STATE_A]
    │                      │
    │                  (condition)
    │                      ▼
    │               [STATE_B] ──(error)──▸ [ERROR]
    │                      │
    │                  (success)
    │                      ▼
    └──────────────▸ ◉ [DONE]
```

Use when: auth flows, checkout/payment, form wizards, real-time sync, connection management, retry logic.
Skip for: simple CRUD, stateless utilities, pure transforms.
See `references/state-machine-guide.md` for notation, patterns, and validation checklist.

## Mental Models

| Model | Application |
|-------|-------------|
| Decomposition | Start with user value, work backward. Tree structure, estimate leaves, sum parents. |
| 80/20 | 20% of work → 80% of value. Sequence high-value tasks first. |
| Risk Management | High-risk tasks early, external dependencies first, unknowns before knowns. |

## Best Practices

- Be specific about files to create/modify
- Include database migrations if needed
- Note breaking changes
- Consider testing strategy
- Estimate conservatively, track actuals
- Mark file ownership for parallel execution safety (parallel mode)
- Use `knowledge-retrieval` before planning, `knowledge-capture` after

## Mode Reference

| Flag | Reference | When |
|------|-----------|------|
| `--fast` | `references/fast-mode.md` | Quick lightweight plan |
| `--deep` | `references/deep-mode.md` | Thorough multi-phase with research |
| `--parallel` | `references/parallel-mode.md` | Parallelizable phases with ownership matrix |
| `--validate` | `references/validate-mode.md` | Validate existing plan |

<request>$ARGUMENTS</request>
<platform>{{detected_platform or "none"}}</platform>

## Agent & Skill Analysis — REQUIRED for Every Plan

Before generating any phase file, analyze `.claude/agents/` and `.claude/skills/skill-index.json` to assign the right executor to each phase.

### Step A — Scan the Agent Catalog

Read every `*.md` in `.claude/agents/` and extract:
- `name` — agent identifier
- `description` — use-case summary
- `skills` — skills the agent pre-loads

Agents available in this kit:
| Agent | Best For |
|-------|----------|
| `backend-developer` | Go/Node APIs, PostgreSQL, auth, REST, migrations |
| `frontend-developer` | React, TanStack Start, TypeScript UI, E2E |
| `tester` | unit/integration/E2E test suites, coverage |
| `devops-engineer` | Docker, CI/CD, infra, cloud deployments |
| `security-auditor` | OWASP audit, secrets scan, auth hardening |
| `code-reviewer` | post-implementation code quality review |
| `git-manager` | commit, push, PR creation |
| `planner` | planning, research coordination |
| `backend-architect` | API contracts, DB schema, ADRs |
| `frontend-architect` | routing hierarchy, component design |
| `researcher` | best practices, library research |
| `debugger` | root cause analysis, stack trace diagnosis |
| `docs-manager` | docs write/update/migrate |
| `muji` | UI design system, component audits |

### Step B — Scan the Skills Catalog

Read `.claude/skills/skill-index.json`. For each phase, match skills by domain signal:

| Domain Signal | Skills to Activate |
|---------------|--------------------|
| Go backend | `golang-pro`, `postgres-pro`, `api-designer` |
| Auth/OAuth/JWT | `golang-pro`, `typescript-pro` |
| SSE / real-time | `websocket-engineer` |
| React / TanStack Start | `tanstack-start`, `react-expert`, `web-frontend` |
| TypeScript frontend | `typescript-pro`, `javascript-pro` |
| E2E / browser testing | `playwright-expert`, `web-testing`, `test` |
| CI/CD / infra | `infra-docker`, `terraform-engineer` |
| Security | `fullstack-guardian` |
| API design | `api-designer`, `graphql-architect` |
| Microservices | `microservices-architect` |
| Architecture decisions | `architecture-designer` |

### Step C — Assign to Phase Files

For every generated `phase-{N}-*.md`, add an **Agent & Skills** section:

```markdown
## Agent & Skills

- **Agent**: `backend-developer`
- **Skills**: `golang-pro`, `postgres-pro`, `api-designer`
- **Handoffs**:
  - After completion → `code-reviewer` (quality gate)
  - On security concern → `security-auditor`
```

**IMPORTANT:** Analyze the skills catalog and activate needed skills.
